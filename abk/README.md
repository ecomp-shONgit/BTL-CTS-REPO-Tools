- Wlang: second part of the textname long term

- UWkurz: canonical addition to the second part of the textname canonical  short term

## Get Input CSV

To get csv files, use the example files or compile them in your own using the given scripts.

Oxford Classical Dictionary: OCD_ABBREVIATIONS.csv

RÜCKER/TLL/PAN: -

Diccionario Griego-Español: dge.csv

## Configure script

Set the name of the input file and the name of the outputfile.

```
###################################
#CONFIG IN AND OUT FILENAME

#DGE
INNAMEFILE = "dge.csv"
OUTNAMEFILE = "dge.txt"

```

## Run Script and copy result

The script is usable with python 2.7 and a Version of Python 3.

```
$ python cvsTOkexvalue.py

```

The resulting output is a key value datastructure known to Python and JavaScript. If you want to put it in use with Javascript you need to satifie the Variable convention, so add the "let xxx =" and the ";" on your own. Same is true for Python (add "xxx=") to the output.
