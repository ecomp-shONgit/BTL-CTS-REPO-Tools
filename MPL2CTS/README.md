# MPL
Since the Patrologia Latina is a canonical work, that means there is a certain way of referencing this work, it is possible to derive the canonical structure form it.

# Usage

Set target folder name ("hsctaFolder"), CTS namespace ("NSSS") and input file folder. The input format is SGML from the MPL.

```

################################### configure
infolder = "MPL-Augustinus"
hsctaFolder = "/Path/to"
NSSS = "MPL"

```

The script is usable with python 2.7 and a Version of Python 3.

```

$ python augustiner.py

```

The script just outputs a repository.
